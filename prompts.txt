Watch this video frame by frame and observe in detail the walking form of the person in the video. Your goal is to analyze their gate and the form of their steps to identify whether or not they are limping. If they are limping, you must provide a detailed explanation of it, what the error is, and what needs to be improved. This person is recovering from an injury and working closely with their physical therapist to regain their walking capabilities, so the physical therapist has requested your frame-by-frame analysis in order to help improve her prognosis for the patient. Therefore, you may use medical terminology and be robust in your answer as it is intended for review by the medical professional.
